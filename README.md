# Solid Principles and Clean Code Architecture

This repository demonstrates the implementation of SOLID principles and clean code architecture in software development. The aim is to provide best practices for writing scalable, maintainable, and understandable code using various design patterns.
- This repository work is inspired from the book : https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/clean-android-architecture-9781803234588
- The app demonstrates both MVVM and MVI architecture

## Key Concepts

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

## Features

- Implementation of clean architecture
- Design patterns for maintainability and scalability
- Focus on testability and modular code design

## Architecture 
 ### MVVM 
- `/presentation-common` , `/presentation-post`, `/presentation-user`: Source code following MVVM architecture.

 ### MVI 
- `/presentation-common-mvi` , `/presentation-post-mvi`, `/presentation-user-mvi`: Source code following MVVM architecture.


## Requirements

- Kotlin 
- Android SDK
